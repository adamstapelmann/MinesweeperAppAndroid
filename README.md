This project includes all necessary files to build the Minesweeper app in Android Studio. 
The project began as an assignment for a mobile development class, but I am still reviewing and improving it.

The most relevant files are the following:

app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml  --> The visual representation of the game
app/src/main/java/hu/ait/minesweeper/MainActivity --> Controls the interaction between java code and the view
app/src/main/java/hu/ait/minesweeper/MinesweeperModel --> Controls game mechanics
app/src/main/java/hu/ait/minesweeper/MinesweeperView --> Controls the drawing of the minesweeper 'board'
app/src/main/java/hu/ait/minesweeper/FieldElement.java --> Contains information for a minesweeper 'tile'
